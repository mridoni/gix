# Building and/or installing Gix-IDE

***Note: the main development - for the moment - takes place on Windows with Visual Studio, mostly to make the work easier and faster. This means that while the intention is to have full cross-platform support, both with regard to feature parity and stability, for obvious reasons the Windows+MingW and Linux builds can be, at a given point in time, lack a feature, or display some quirk or instability.***

## Installing from a binary package

Binary packages are available for Windows and Linux (Ubuntu 20.04). Windows packages come in two flavors: one that includes a set of GnuCOBOL compilers (in Visual Studio and MingW/GCC varieties) and a "barebone" package that only installs the IDE and tools. The latter version of the package can be customized to point at your current GnuCOBOL installation, if so desired, or to a compiler install of your choice. Linux packages only include the IDE and tools and expect you to supply a working install of the compiler, either from your distribution or self-compiled. Beware: in order to be able to use the debugging facilities that Gix-IDE provides, you will need GnuCOBOL 3.1 or greater, the 2.x version is supported, to some extent, only for editing and compiling. The packages can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/mridoni/gix/releases) page on GitHub.

All the packages are signed with my GPG private key. The corresponding public key (m.ridoni@gmail.com, fingerprint 70E4 08CF B89B 5FA8 32E4 5292 EFDC 94BD 5260 B939) has been published on pgp.mit.edu and keyserver.ubuntu.com.

### Windows

The installer places Gix-IDE in C:\Program Files and creates a data directory, either in C:\ProgramData or in %LOCALAPPDATA%, where it stores the compilers (if provided with the installer) and the compiler definition files.

The compilers available on [Arnold Trembley's page](https://www.arnoldtrembley.com/GnuCOBOL.htm) have been successfully tested with Gix-IDE.

The installer will install the runtimes for Visual Studio 2015-2019 and the x86 version of the runtime for Visual Studio 2013 (needed for libmysql on x86). If you choose to install the Visual Studio-based compilers, the Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 and the Windows SDK will be installed as well (this implies a download of about 2GB).

### Linux
Linux packages are - for now - only available for Ubuntu 20.04 in .deb format, and can be downloaded from GitHub (along with the corresponding signature). The package has some dependencies, that can be installed with:

    apt install qt5-default libqt5xmlpatterns5 libqtermwidget5-0 libdwarf1 libelf++0 libdwarf++0 libmysqlclient21 libpq5 unixodbc

or, more easily, once you have downloaded the .deb file:

    apt install ./gix-ide-linux-x64-1.0.2-xxxx.deb

(the local path is the important part, that will allow apt to automatically download and install all the dependencies).

The package is installed in /opt/gix-ide, and the IDE can be launched with:

    /opt/gix-ide/bin/gix-ide

The install location (outside of the /usr or /usr/local trees) is a bit unconventional, but it will be used until both Gix-IDE and the packaging process are more stable (in case of problems, a rm -rf on the install directory will take care of most things for sure).

## Building from source

### Windows,, with Visual Studio or Visual Studio Tools

 - Download the [Qt GPL SDK](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) and install it, selecting the "msvc" package (the VS2017 version works perfectly under VS2019). Gix-IDE uses 5.14.2, so that version is recommended, but a newer version should do as well.
 - If you don't have Visual Studio installed on your computer download   and install Visual Studio C++ Build Tools 2019 from here:
   https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/it/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16#
   or install Visual Studio Community. While the Build Tools are enough  to build Gix-IDE, having the full VS IDE available will obviously  make applying small fixes to solution and project files (e.g. paths,  environment variables) much easier.  Download the binary  prerequisites and uncompress them in a folder:
	 - [MySQL x64 binaries](https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-5.7/mysql-5.7.31-winx64.zip)
   	 - [PostgreSQL x64 binaries](https://sbp.enterprisedb.com/getfile.jsp?fileid=1257551&_ga=2.17284795.341452640.1615031602-1234917009.1613646523)
   	 
 You can probably use newer versions without problems, the versions linked are the ones currently in use to build the binary packages. Since we are only using the client libraries and headers, older versions should not be a problem. 32-bit versions of the runtime libraries are also available on the respective websites, should you intend to build a 32-bit version of Gix-IDE.
 - Clone the repository or download the snapshot
 - Install cmake (if not already installed)
 - You will need the **Qt Visual Studio Tools**:  unfortunately they are only available as a VSIX extension, so if you are using the VS C++ Build Tools (no full VS), go into the "build-tools" directory and extract the QtMsBuild.zip archive somewhere (this a repackaged version of the Qt Visual Studio Tools). If you are using the full Visual Studio IDE, just download and install the [Qt Visual Studio Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheQtCompany.QtVisualStudioTools2019) (follow the link or use The Extension Manager in Visual Studio).
 - If you are using the VS C++ Build Tools, you will have to manually download the nuget.exe executable from [here](https://www.nuget.org/downloads).
   
 - Set up a few environment variables (if you are using the full Visual Studio IDE, obviously do that in Windows **before** launching Visual Studio) like in the example below (obviously using the correct paths:
	- MYSQL_HOME=C:\mysql-5.7.31-winx64
	- PGSQL_HOME=C:\pgsql-9.5.22-x64
	- MYSQL32_HOME=C:\mysql-5.7.31-win32
	- PGSQL32_HOME=C:\pgsql-9.5.23-x86
	- GNUCOBOL_HOME=C:\GnuCOBOL-2.2
	- QTDIR=C:\Qt\5.14.2\msvc2017_64
	- QtMsBuild=C:\Users\gix-builder\QtMsBuild
	- QtToolsPath=C:\Qt\5.14.2\msvc2017_64\bin
	- NUGET_EXE=C:\Users\gix-builder\nuget.exe
**Note**:
		- the *32_HOME variables are only used to build 32-bit versions of the ESQL libraries (useful if you want to target x86 beside x64) or a 32-bit version of Gix-IDE. If you're targeting x64 only you can safely ignore them. If you are using them, you will also need to download x86 binary versions of MySQL and PostgreSQL, as indicated above.
		- GNUCOBOL_HOME must point to an existing install of GnuCOBOL
		
- Open a Visual Studio "Developer Command Prompt" and navigate to the directory where you have uncompressed the Gix-IDE source.
- Run `<path to nuget.exe>\nuget.exe restore` (this should download and install a NuGet Package)
- Go into the `libs/libdwarf` subdirectory and run `cmake . -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"`, then go back up to the source root directory
- Run `msbuild gix-ide.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64` to build Gix-IDE

If all goes well, you should find the binaries in the **x64** directory.

### Windows, with MinGW-w64/MSYS2

 - Gix-IDE uses C++17 features, so ensure your GCC version is "not really old"
 - Download and install the Qt SDK (same versions as above)
 - Install cmake in MSYS2 (if not already installed)
 - Clone or download the repository
 - Set up the environment variables as above (you cam obviously ignore QtMsBuild and QtToolsPath)
 - Go into the `libs/libdwarf` subdirectory and run `cmake . -G "MSYS Makefiles"`, then go back up to the source root directory
 - run `qmake` (or `qmake CONFIG+=debug` if you want to build a debug-enabled version)
 - run make

If all goes well, you should find the binaries in the **x64/Release** directory, the main executable is **gix-ide.exe**. 

You might need to add Qt's library path to your PATH variable, in order to launch gix-ide.

### Linux
You will need to install some dependencies to build:
`apt install build-essential qtbase5-dev libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev libqtermwidget5-0-dev libdwarf-dev libelfin-dev qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libmysqlclient-dev libpq-dev unixodbc-dev flex libnng-dev libspdlog-dev libfmt-dev`

You will also need a version of bison newer than the one provided by Ubuntu. You can download it from Debian's repositories and install it over the current one: 

    wget    http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/b/bison/bison_3.7.5+dfsg-1_amd64.deb
and

    sudo apt ./bison_3.7.5+dfsg-1_amd64.deb
	
	(the leading `./` **is** important: apt will install from a local file, but honoring dependencies)

Then:
 - Download and install the Qt SDK (same versions as above)
 - Clone or download the repository
 - Set up the environment variables as above (you can obviously ignore QtMsBuild and QtToolsPath)
 - Install cmake (if not already installed)
 - Go into the `libs/libdwarf` subdirectory and run `cmake .`, then go back up to the source root directory
 - run `qmake` (or `qmake CONFIG+=debug` if you want to build a debug-enabled version)
 - run make

If all goes well, you should find the binaries in the **x64/Release** directory, the main executable is **gix-ide**.

You might need to add Qt's library path to your PATH variable, in order to launch gix-ide.
