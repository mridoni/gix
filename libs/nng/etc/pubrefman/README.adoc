= pubrefman

This directory contains a tool to publish (update) the reference manual
on the NNG documentation site.

Run it with --help for options.  You can build it with Go.

It normally uploads to github, and will require a working SSH agent.

If you're not a project maintainer, you probably don't need this tool.
